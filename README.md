🏗️ Interior Design Work Schedule (90 Days)

This project visualizes a 90-day interior fit-out work schedule using a detailed Gantt-style timeline.
It breaks down each phase — from mobilization to handover — with color-coded categories for Electrical, HVAC, Plumbing, Gypsum, and Finishing works.

📋 Project Overview

The visualization provides a clear understanding of:

Project phases and activity durations

Overlapping MEP, partition, and finishing works

Key milestones (e.g., MEP completion, partition fix, handover)

Optimized workflow for interior construction management
